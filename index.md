### Business Automation
  [# NCCD: Transformation and Display through Google Data Studio](https://github.com/andrewcarr6239/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/ExcelReportGeneration.ipynb)
    - School, many processes were manually being completed which I could automate using python on google colab. Alot of these processes relate to recording the amount of support provided to each child. At the school each child required 3 google forms completed per staff member per day. The results of this form had to be collated and put in a format which could easily be placed into each teachers unit plan. The first part of solving this problem was running a report every week which collated all forms submitted across the school and creating an excel file for each subject for each year for each subject and saving it within the schools google drive. As a result a process which was taking a management staff member 3-4 hours each week now only took me 10 minutes per week. After taking a term using this porcess I discovered google data studio which provided a much cleaner interface and much for streamlined process for collating and sharing the submitted forms.
